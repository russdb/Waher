## Waher for the new age

This is a port of the old and popular Waher theme for vscode. There is currently a pre alpha version to debug in vscode.  

Also included is a swatch which has the color and the number of times the color is used in the notepad++ theme, as well as an image with the most popular colors.

Road Map:
